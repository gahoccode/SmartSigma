Create a streamlit web app that combine hrp.py for hierarchical risk parity and mvo.py for mean-variance optimization. The app should allow users to input their own data, select the type of optimization (HRP or MV), and visualize the results.
The project uses the PyPortfolioOpt library for HRP and MVO optimization.
